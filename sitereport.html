                <h1> Home Page</h1>
                <p>The home page is where this site began life, it was the page that went through hundreds of different iterations. Especially, since it was the page, I first implemented mobile optimisation. This page mostly consists of the responsive menu, some text and pictures fit into a simple grid layout. This is just to welcome users to the page. </p>
                
                <p>For the mobile optimisation I learned through lots of failure that it really helps to break html down into different sections with different tags. As getting it all to work in one will cause issues. To achieve this optimisation, I first made the header with the links to other pages. </p>
                    
                <p> I then used a media query stating that once the website reached a certain width that it would swap to a different stylesheet. This one hid the current header off screen, this could then be called in through the burger menu (created and styled through span lines due to CSS limitations) , when toggled through the hidden checkbox revealing the menu. Taking up the whole mobile screen. The other contents should also display inline down the mobile screen instead of trying to fit horizontally in an awkward manner across the screen.</p>

                <p>This way the navigation is now optimised for mobile meaning theoretically that the site should now be ubiquitous across MOST devices.</p>

                <h1> Contact Page </h1>
                <p>The contact page is for users to get into contact with site owners/admins by sending in comments or messages through forms. This page was created to demonstrate our understanding of using form controls.

                <p>Like with most of the other pages this one uses the same template created from the index page with a grid container containing the content of the page. This quite simply uses three columns with some text to the left, form in the center with my details and picture in the right column.</p>
                    
                <p>Personally, I found this page to be quite difficult since I did not want to go overboard and clutter the page with random controls that do not mean anything. I liked to keep it simple and easy for the user. Not only that, but if the user must jump through hoops just to fill in some details they might not bother because it is an exhausting process, this page will definitely face tweaks at some point.</p>

                <p>On top of this, I am not too happy with how it looks and think it could use some more features to make it more engaging and responsive for the user. As currently it only informs the user the required fields that need to be filled out. There is just an empty and redundant feeling about this page to me that I cannot shake.</p>

                <h1> Portfolio Page </h1>
                <p>This portfolio page while currently barebones (-ish) will be used in future to showcase my work completed from this year. Currently, in place are placeholder images, text and headers as right now I don not have/know what to fill them with. </p>


                <p>This page ended up becoming one of my favourites because I believe this is where GRID ended up working the best and just the whole layout of the page works great in my opinion. Secondly, instead of overloading the page with lots and lots of other text boxes, the user can hover over the images (click on mobile) to reveal the text about the specific image. This to me is the only page that is really 100% complete and happy with.</p>

                <h1> Site Report Page </h1>
                <p>Another page I believe works well; this is where you SHOULD be right now! This just contains my final thoughts in a report style on the website. I thought it would be more digestible to break it down by page. Then with a conclusion at the end to wrap things up.</p>
                
                <p>This page is very close to the index page as it takes most of its foundations and reworks the grid slightly, but you should see a very close resemblance.

                <h1> Site Blog Page </h1>
                <p>This page contains blog entries I took during the process of creating this site. I tried to get one from the beginning of the project, middle and nearing the end. That way we can gauge my thoughts over time, lessons learned and how my mindset about web development would change. 
                
                <p>Like the prior pages, this simply combines the layout with the responsive navbar in addition to a grid container, with some paragraphs and pictures. </p>
                    
                <p>Again, I find myself conflicted on the layout of this page since it will be difficult for anyone but me to correspond which image goes to which paragraph. Then again, that could very well be the point, just a random compilation of images timelining the sites progress. This could also be remedied with the same overlay method used on the portfolio page.</p>

                <h1> Conclusion </h1>
                <p>Overall, I would say I am pleased with how this project turned out. It amounted to a greater result than what I had originally expected. Especially, with my zero knowledge and prior experience. I have learned a lot of lessons from this project which I will take away with me into the future. I now have a new way of looking at web development accompanied by a new way of working. </p>
                
                <p>The responsive menu proved to be the most challenging part of the project for me and took the most tries to perfect and get right with few issues. This contrasts other processes and techniques used on this site which went smooth and straightforward. </p>

                <p>A common theme throughout this site you probably have noticed is my disappointment towards the theme and layout of the site. I cannot decide on a colour scheme or even a GRID container layout I can be truly happy with. I put this down to lack of prototyping/planning before hand leading to this current unsettlement I have. Hence, why I have chosen to last minute to put any final pictures of the website in. </p>

                <p>Between finishing the report and the projects deadline, I believe there will be many more changes made and/or added. Whether for the better or the worst I will still be pleased. </p>
