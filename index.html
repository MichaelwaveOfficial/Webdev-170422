                    <h1> Welcome to my website!</h1>
                    <p> Enjoy your stay, a lot of hard work and effort went into this. A solid few weeks of work just here.</p>
                    <p> There are five different pages to this site which I encourage you to explore. This the home page is just to greet the user and what I thought would be a good place to talk about why this website was created.</p>
                    <p> Then we have the contact page where you can find my details and get into contact with me, feel free to send over any queries or just feedback for the site. </p>
                    <p> Thirdly, is the portfolio page which currently does not have any work to display. However, in the near future will have some of my work completed this year to showcase my skills. </p>
                    <p> Finally, we have the site blog and report pages. The blog page containing little entries documenting my thought process throughout the sites creation with screenshots. Then we have the report page covering where I stand on the site now the project has been completed. This should also include screenshots proving the sites validation.</p>

                    <h1> Why was this site created? </h1>
                    <p> This site was created as part of an assignment to demonstrate my ability in building a website strictly using HTML and CSS. Not only is it to show off skills, it is to communicate how we found the whole learning process, recording the highs and the lows, the processes we breezed through and which hindered our progress. </p>
                    <p> Ontop of this, we can communicate our creative decisions and why we might have used certain techniques over others. What worked and what didn't?</p>
                    <p> Finally, both Git and Github played a huge part in this assignment. Making sure to git commit regularly saving and recording our changes uploading them to our repository making sure to have multiple branches. That way we can ensure we learn what good practice looks like for us aspiring developers.</p>
