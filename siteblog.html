                <h1> Welcome Entry 28/03/2022 </h1>
                
                <p> Welcome to the first entry! So far, creating this site has had its highs and its lows. Starting from scratch with little to no prior experience with html or css this to me has proven to be quite the challenge. Most of the different processes are fairly straightforward and easy to get your head around eventually. However, there is one thing that has been the most challenging of them all, somewhat hindering progress and consuming a lot of precious time. That is the repsonsive burger menu which for some reason has stumped me. Heres a picture to the right of what I have right now. Not impressive but I am sure progress can be made!! </p>
                
                <p> The issue is that I cant seem to get a site that works for both mobile and desktop, I can replicate either or but not both which is very annoying. I'm hoping its just a media query issue or maybe mixing of tags. I think the next move will have to be just keep creating different prototypes trying different methods until one works.</p>
                
                <p> I have also found that trying to create a page or produce a layout with little to no planning beforehand is very poor practice, as when the time comes, it is very difficult just to throw something together and be happy with the end result. </p>

                <h1> Second Entry 04/04/2022 </h1>
            
                <p> Progress has been made and the responsive menu has been conquered. A big takeaway from this project so far is to split different parts of the website into different sections and tags. Almost breaking things down and abstracting them as much as possible. Otherwise, cramming too much into one tag//section causes confusion and errors. Now thats done, we can hopefully make good progress towards getting this site finished.  </p>
                
                <p> At this point every page has been created with each one having its foundations laid out. Now all I need to do is flesh them out with some actual content and words that aren't just Lorem Ipsum. Animations and other key features also still need to be implemented. </p>
                
                <p> I would say by now I have quite a good understanding of how GRID works. At the begining it was an odd concept to get my head around as I felt I overthought a lot of it. After lots of practice and research later I found there is a much easier way of achieving the same result simply by specifying how many GRID columns you required. If a section required two columns you could easily specify how many columns you wanted it to span. No need for the rows or labelling sections and laying it all out in a template with the tags. </p>

                <h1> Third Entry 10/04/2022 </h1>
                <p> The site has come a long way since this project begun. Fairly happy with the path it is taking and I am now confident that it will produce a good result. Currently, most pages resemble the final product and are awaiting the finishing touches to polish them up and make them look more professional.  </p>

                <p> Those tweaks probably include little bits like spacing, box shadows, font sizes and lots of other tiny little tweaks. One thing I am struggling to conclude as I come closer to finishing is the colour scheme. I picked the current one because I believed it would work well at the start. However, now it's the opposite. I feel it requires something slick without looking too boring or cut and paste. I really would like this to stand out. Hoping to have a breakthrough with animations.</p>
