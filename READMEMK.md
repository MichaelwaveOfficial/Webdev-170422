 *Current work pushed to Github. Index page mostly complete, will finish and refine once other pages reach completion. 

*each other page has been created and had a similar template to the index page has been attributed. These could very well change in future. However, providing good foundations to work from. 
 Just need to figure out what to fill the empty space with.

* html skeletons provided for all pages. Now we can focus on polishing them up. Having thoughts about tweaking the pages colour scheme.

* Adding more to the skeleton of the website. Fleshing bits out and fixing errors which were causing issues. Primarily, with not using enough tags and trying to bite off more than i could chew. 

* Grid layouts should mostly resemble the final product and its now time to fill the different objects with the right content and polish things off. Overall, making things look a little nicer and giving that more finished feeling.

* Pages are now complete, awaiting optimisations to have them polished for submission.
